# telegram-channel-downloader-
üîë Key Features
Telegram API Integration:
The script employs TelegramClient from Telethon to authenticate and interact with the Telegram API using your api_id and api_hash.

Channel Access:
It retrieves the full channel details using GetFullChannelRequest, allowing access to the channel's metadata and messages.

Media Downloading:
The download_media function iterates over messages in the specified channel, downloading media files (such as photos, videos, documents) to a local directory named after the channel.

Progress Tracking:
Integration with the tqdm library provides a visual progress bar in the console, indicating the download status of media files.

Session Management:
The script uses a session file ('name') to maintain the user's login session, preventing the need for re-authentication on subsequent runs.

Message Offset Handling:
By specifying a starting_message_id, the script begins downloading media from that message ID, decrementing the ID to traverse earlier messages.
